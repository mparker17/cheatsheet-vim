# Vim cheat sheet

A cheat sheet for using Vim. Created in OmniGraffle 5.4.

# Motivation

When I started using Vim, I had trouble remembering how to do a lot of things, so I made a cheat sheet. Other new Vim users have found it useful too.

## Why OmniGraffle?

I made the cheat sheet in OmniGraffle, a closed-source piece of software, because I happened to have it around, and I knew I'd be accomplish what I wanted using it.

I used OmniGraffle version 5 because that's what I happen to have a license for.

I'm open to switching to a more-open format, but I haven't had time to learn another program and port the cheat sheet.
